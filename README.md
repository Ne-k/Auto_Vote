# How to use
1) In the `Auto_Vote.py` you'll have to change this to `driver.get("<Your Voting page URL>")` with your URL to who you want to vote for the CampusTech giveaway.

"URL" as an the https://campustech.org/tech-the-halls?entry_id=xxx URL, you can get that URL from clicking the share button on whoever you want to spam vote.

2) Run `python install -r requirements.txt` or `py install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies
3) Run autovote.bat to start the script

*Should be easy to understand*
